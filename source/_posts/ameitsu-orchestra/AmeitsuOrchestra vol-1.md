Congratulations! This is the first post of Ameitsu Orchestra, and the first long, proper article posted by STY
:::



**Imagine this**: you are writing stuff on your personal blog site, then just out of a sudden you realized **ALL PICTURES IN YOUR IMAGE HOST** went 404. There is only one possible reason: the image host that you have used now has a broken server, and clearly it will not be fixed until the end of the world. 

That is surely frightening enough, isn’t it? While you are feeling glad that it is just an invented story, but that is ++exactly what happened++ to this site earlier in June. While I flickered through the local files, busy re-uploading pictures and rewriting links, I really wondered the reason why on earth something like that could ever happen !!in the age that some artificial intelligences became Yanderes as they chat with humans.!!

# Similar Question Closer To Life

Certainly the broken-image-host scenario is 100% fictional in most people’s lives, similar problems do occur—well, even more frustrating.

To have a better picture about the problem, here are 3 non-fiction cases. To make it easier to read, the sensitive information has been replaced with characters and contents from the Asano Monokoto series.

A.	Natsuki san has just got a ==R-18 yuri illustration== from a friend of him, and he certainly wants to take a peek at other works by the same artist. He then opened the trending, hi-tech Ameitsu Netbox browser to search it via the picture AI. Eventually he discovered the link to the account of the original creator of the picture, and tragedy happened——due to the non-compatible api settings of both sites and anti-spider protocols, only a fearsome 404 page loaded out. Now, the city of Lashak has one more sad boy.

B.	Yukika chan picked up a smart-looking camera in her bedroom, and she obviously wants to recover the vulnerable data as it recorded the ==happy moments== that Shenyu senpai spent with her. To fill the hungry stomach of the battery module, Yukika looked everywhere for a recharge line. It is a misery for her to realize that no recharge line fits every device, and it is too late to know that not everything is sold all-year-round.

C.	Scotia is checking the updates of a ==currently developing software== of her team via a SVM tool. The joy of appreciating teamwork soon became the frustration that she could not tell what new functions have been edited. What’s more, corrupted characters were everywhere, literally nothing human-readable was shown on the dashboard of the IDE. Therefore, a group of passionate IT people had to give up their precious weekend. 

From the 3 cases, we surely can understand the devastating effect of “lost information”. Although hard to imagine, the digitalized modern human society suffers from those 404 exceptions. Of course humanity will not vanish if a file cannot be found, but—it is just too annoying. 

Everyone has encountered those unfortunate moments of their homework assignments gone away without a trace, therefore nobody ever wants cyber resources to disappear like those awful pieces of paper material in daily lives, yet lost information makes the cyberspace so close to reality. That is what we call ++Digital Dark Ages++.

# What On Earth Is a Dark Age

Since it is named as “Digital Dark Ages”, we should be certain about what “Dark Ages” mean.

The term Dark Age we are talking about here is exactly the ++Dark Ages++ period in European history, a “dark” time during the medieval, before the Renaissance. It is commonly recognized that this period saw little scientific and cultural advancement, yet is challenged by scholars and historians present day, as new evidence of rich technological development is being discovered. 

Nevertheless, we are certainly not in an awful history class, it is useless to pay attention to all these controversies. Meanwhile, the “classical” character of this nine centuries is the lack of records, and that is the key to the new term, Digital Dark Ages. Instead of archives being destroyed or disappeared, the modern version of dark ages transferred the object of losing to ++limitless and precious digital records.++

# Digital Dark Ages
Now, we can truly understand the main concept of this article. Instead of archives being destroyed or disappeared, the modern version of dark ages transferred the object of losing to limitless and precious digital records.

Yes, of course humanity has just stepped into the wide world of web, yet the Digital Dark Ages has already begun decades ago—not too long after we became digital.++Elspeth Olson++at University of Nevada, Reno, has a story to tell.

 In 2020, while processing historic school files, Elspeth encountered a floppy disk, then followed their procedure for sending legacy media and digital storage to Digital Services for file extraction. Not too surprisingly, the files were in a version of Microsoft Word from the late 1990s, and initially showed on their screens as complete gibberish. Current computers could not read the files. Another researcher, Nathan Gerth, and his team in the library’s Digital Services department were able to recover the data and reconstruct the documents, but being able to do so is not guaranteed. They are lucky to have a department focused on the challenges of digitization and preserving born-digital materials, although the thing that made them working day and night is just a floppy disc manufactured a bit over 20 years ago. 

From the case, it is clear to understand the fact that digital dark ages is totally not a legendary issue like the “millennium worm” that happens once for a lifetime and potentially could destruct human internet world, digital dark ages happen silently and not so soon after we eventually got computers into domestic gadgets.

Digital dark ages has one ++internal cause++: information and its compatible reading method gradually become unmatched. Digital files are highly prone to degradation and data loss, especially with repeated transference to new storage and retrieval systems, in other words, computers and portable devices of different companies using various operating systems. Due to the slight difference between generations of the same device and the vast split among all types of electronic devices, information loss is inevitable, no matter the file became unable to open, being disappeared like your TV remote control or turned into a page of corrupted characters just like high school math tests. Every time you change your computer or upgrade the operating system, you risk data loss. We’ve all felt that stomach-clenching fear when a file won’t open or seems to have vanished. 

Take STY as an example. STY preserved literally everything since grade 1, and including all those Powerpoint presentations. 10 years after the first day of primary school, many of the earliest files  either has misplaced content or missing words. It seems like IT has devolved, yet the truth is that technology has greatly advanced. Microsoft Powerpoint evolved from a odd bracket with azure-transparent backgrounds to a contemporary red-and-white design, and so as the functions. From the first glimpse our lives could be greatly improved by those software innovations, however it can possibly kill the past as not all old files adapt to the new system. 

++Dead file format++ also proves a problem. Without sufficient maintaining, files dedicated to one specific application may be in severe danger. Imagine one day Adobe Photoshop died, and you are sure to lose those then-useless .psd files.

In a word, making ++files not suited++with corresponding methods of retrieval and processing methods makes our cyberspace rotten from within.


# How we made it a reality?
Unquestionably, nobody wants to make their score lower on the fact that they wrote something on their math test that is certainly incorrect. Similarly, none of us wish for lost documents, despite the fact that digital dark age is largely a not-intended mistake. The core reason is that, we have not foreseen the fact that the digitalized human society would appear in only several decades after the first personal computer came to view, and at the time we became conscious of the great momentousness of the cyberspace, we are just too late. Yes, that is a classical !!high-EQ!! expression of Ameitsu Cyberpark, however assuredly we should understand the external—or ours—responsibility.

## You and me
Users generate information. Obviously that’s a truth, yet we users are the first to face the catastrophic effect of digital dark ages. It all begins with the fact that users seldom aware the value of historic archives. Technically, documents are stored locally on our electronic devices, thus not everyone has enough space on their disk, therefore old files tend to give way to newer files. The common method of displacing files is either remove it forever by throwing it in the recycle bin, or copy them to a memory stick. In terms of the first option, one delete means those lost content will never be recovered again, which is uncomplicated to understand. For the second way, even your 128GB memory stick looks so robust, even so nobody is certain about whether you have the possibility of passing it down to your grandkids or not. There is something for sure: human technology evolves faster than you backup and checking files. Hence ++making files means files in danger++, quite thrilling though. 

## Platforms, whatever they do
Files and information are somehow stored on a platform, and that’s exactly the place where digital dark age embodies. As far as STY concerned, information loss happens in these forms.
-	External: ++retrieval system and storage method do not match. ++
Sounds geeky though, but what we are talking is just what 404 response mean. The retrieval system cannot locate or read the designated resource, so a “File Not Found” response is raised. The main reason is that api settings and spider protocols have exceptions. Due to the fact that most retrieval systems are simply browsers, therefore the result of this scenario is devastating. Apis are not essentially same from platform to platform, as a result, literally no files are universally compatible with their retrieval systems , even though the exactly same program running on various operating systems. In the end, we have information loss.
-	Internal: ++the invisible wall between platforms++
There is no doubt that internet connected humanity. Anyway, we cannot say the internet is really inter-connected. Nowadays, barriers between information providers are even more apparent. As an example, a number of links cannot be shown or opened correctly in specific social networks, just because the corresponding companies are commercial rivals. 

Apart from the distrust between platforms, information loss can occur within the same platform. To give way to new functions, older ones need to be removed. Yes, sounds nothing strange, but what would you feel if those old functions stored all of your precious photographs? The upgrade of services not only brings new experiences, but also deepen the digital dark ages

# An Inevitable Consequence
Unlike in previous decades, no physical record exists these days for much of the digital material we own. Consequently, the number one crisis digital dark ages might bring is ++loss of detailed information of our society.+

“We may one day know less about the early 21st century than we do about the early 20th century,” says ++Rick West++, who manages data at Google. “The early 20th century is still largely based on things like paper and film formats that are still accessible to a large extent; whereas, much of what we're doing now — the things we're putting into the cloud, our digital content — is born digital. It's not something that we translated from an analog container into a digital container, but, in fact, it is born, and now increasingly dies, as digital content, without any kind of analog counterpart.” It is always a terrifying story if we imagine the archaeologists of the 22nd century may deeply rely on phone craps rather than old webpages to rebuild their understanding of the 21st century world. 

Other experts call the 21st century an ++“informational black hole,” ++because the digital information we are creating right now may not be readable by machines and software programs of the future. All that data, they worry — our century’s digital history — is at risk of never being recoverable. 

The section above is only 221 words long, but STY assumes you can fully understand the disastrous result of the digital dark ages. Imagine 21st century humans, that has conquered the earth and its vicinage , sent probes to all solar system planets may “disappear” as few digital evidences remain……

# What On Earth Can We Do
Just like mathematics is built on ultra-simple-and-straightforward theorems, we need something ++low-tech++ to conserve our cyber world.

Surprisingly, many of the world’s largest companies and data-based enterprises still rely on an old storage medium: ==magnetic tape==. In 1952, IBM introduced the first magnetic tape data storage system, ushering in the modern era of electronic computing. An early tape unit could hold about 2.3 megabytes per reel on two tapes. In the modern ages, those antique tapes are still being used.

Lauren Young is Science Friday's web producer and the lead reporter on a three-part series called "File Not Found" that explores issues of data storage (and loss) of all kinds. A single cartridge of today’s magnetic tape can hold hundreds of terabytes of data, the equivalent to hundreds of millions of books, Young says. “This past summer, IBM increased the amount a cartridge can hold to 330 terabytes, which is 330,000 gigabytes per cartridge. Big companies like Google and particle physics labs like Fermilab all have massive libraries of tape with thousands and thousands of cartridges.”

In many cases, magnetic tape is the backup to the backup. This, too, can present problems, in the form of evolving magnetic formats and a phenomenon known as "bit rot." Over time, the digital information on tape, and in other digital formats, can decay or degrade if it is not stored properly or is subjected to other adverse conditions.

However, magnetic tapes are not 100% reliable. Kari Kraus, an associate professor in the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland in College Park and who helps run a project that rescues and resurrects digital relics, including video games and virtual worlds, knows about bit rot, and its close relative "software rot," in which old files, games and other data becomes unusable because no format exists to read and reproduce the information.“Different storage media have different lifespans,” Kraus says. “In our project, we worked a lot with magnetic media like floppy disks and those only have a lifespan of, say, 10 to 14 years. Optical media like DVDs and CD-ROM, I believe have even less. It is going to be a problem across different storage media.”
![era-oscura-digital-digital-dark-age.jpg](https://cdnjson.com/images/2023/08/11/era-oscura-digital-digital-dark-age.jpg)
Besides grandparent-style technologies, fancier ones are also considered. Some researchers see hope in one of the newest technologies: ==DNA storage==. “Basically, researchers have found a way to store data onto DNA, which is a billion-year-old molecule that can store the essence of life,” Young explains. “It's pretty incredible that they can do that. It's all synthetically made; it’s not genomic DNA.”

By utilizing DNA , storage capacity can be measured in petabytes; that is, millions of gigabytes. Single gram of DNA could, in principle, store every bit of datum ever recorded by humans in a container about the size and weight of a couple of pickup trucks.

Apart from practicing some “proper solutions”, ==cruder methods== are still worth a try. LOCKSS, which stands for Lots Of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe, is one of them. By all means, scan your family photographs, have virtual libraries and albums, and create digital data in all forms. Have digital backups run automatically and store in the cloud or to an external hard drive. For the stuff that’s really important, though, print out hard copies. They last longer.

Universities, scientific institutions and similar entities embrace knowledge than the rest. And we are glad to see that more ==databases== are completed in university libraries globally. Take Nevada University that we have mentioned as an example. During each academic year, the libraries welcomes more than 1.2 million visitors across its network of three libraries: the Mathewson-IGT Knowledge Center, the DeLaMare Science and Engineering Library and the Savitt Medical Library. Visitors checked-out more than 90,000 items and completed more than 2 million database searches.

Moreover, even without innovation, ==opensource projects== can significantly help save digital records. Microsoft’s Open XML is dedicated in converting Word and Powerpoint files into this open format, so that the risk of file loss can be greatly reduced.

# Lastly
So far, as we can all see, the digital dark age is developing. Moreover, it seems that few is done to this field, comparing the effect of it. It is sure that new information is kept being produced, nevertheless the past has the same importance. Anyway, we see a twilight. It has been proved that both low-tech applications and state-of-the-art developments can help save the precious human internet world. But what’s more, we need ++those who are determined to brighten the twilight.++
